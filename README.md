# VSLAM

Robotic vacuum cleaner with a monocular camera that creates a virtual map of its surroundings using vSLAM technology to avoid obstacles and carry out its tasks with ease. With this approach, we intend to lower the cost, while also not compromising on quality. 
We must generate high levels of efficiency and deploy them on low-power and high-efficiency boards like the Raspberry Pi or Jetson-Nano.
